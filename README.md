Phasebook is a single-page, full-stack web application built with Ruby on Rails, React/Redux (featuring Javascript, HTML/CSS) and PostgreSQL.

## Features and Implementation  

  The app contains the following features:

  * Creating/editing/deleting posts
  * Commenting
  * Likes
  * Friending
  * Search

### User Authentication

  - The app utilizes a custom-made backend and frontend authentication protocol to allow
    permissive activities on the app.

  

  - Creating posts (text and image)

    * Viewing posts only of those

  - Likes on posts/comments

## Future Works

Phasebook has a long way to go to. In the future, I plan to work/implement the following:

* Continued bug-fixes and refactoring

* Replies to comments (comments on comments) and replies to replies

* Messenger => Being able to chat with your friends in real time

* Miscellaneous interactivity/detailing that makes an app a social app:

  - Being able to view friend list and friends' friend lists
  - About section for more detail about a user
