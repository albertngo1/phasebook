Phasebook is a single-page, full-stack web application built with Ruby on Rails, React/Redux (featuring Javascript, HTML/CSS) and PostgreSQL.

## Features and Implementation  

  - Creating a user and logging in

### User Authentication

  - The app utilizes a backend and frontend authentication protocol 

  - Creating posts (text and image)

  - Adding, accepting, removing, canceling friend/friend requests
    * Viewing posts only of those

  - Likes on posts/comments

  - Comments on posts

  - Newsfeed page

## Future Works

Phasebook has a long way to go to. In the future, I plan to work/implement the following:

* Continued bug-fixes and refactoring

* Replies to comments (comments on comments) and replies to replies

* Messenger => Being able to chat with your friends in real time

* Miscellaneous interactivity/detailing that makes an app a social app:
  - Birthdays
  - Trending events
  - Story ticker feed
  - Being able to view friend list and friends' friend lists
  - About section for more detail about a user
